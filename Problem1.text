Given an array, please get the length of the longest incrementing sequence. 
The element order in the sequence should be same as the element order in the array. 
For example, in the array [1, 6, 3, 5, 9, 7], the longest incrementing sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7 and the length is 4. 
If there is a tie feel free to print any of the sequences.
